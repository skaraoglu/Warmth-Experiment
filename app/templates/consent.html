                <strong>WHAT IS THE KEY INFORMATION YOU NEED TO HELP ME DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY OR NOT?</strong>
            
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - WHAT ARE YOU BEING ASKED TO DO?</strong><br>
                If you agree to be in this study, you are being asked to participate in the following:<br><br>
            
                Complete a short demographics survey. You will be introduced to a multi-armed bandit game where you choose from different stock options to maximize your gain.
                First, you will play the game for 10 episodes with a AI. Following the first game, you will be asked to explain your strategy in the first game.
                Then you will be paired with a AI that provides recommendations and text explanations every episode for 30 episodes to help you achieve the
                best outcome according to their strategies. You will also be asked to complete surveys about the way you and your AI worked together.
                You must complete this study in one sitting. The study is expected to take 20 minutes on average. Please <b>avoid mobile devices</b>, as the study is like a game;
                small screens don't show full information. 
            
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - ANY POSSIBLE RISKS OR DISCOMFORTS?</strong><br>
                No foreseeable risks or discomforts, beyond those present in routine daily life, are anticipated in this study.
            
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - ANY DIRECT BENEFITS FOR YOU?</strong><br>
                Although, there is no direct benefit, you will help the researchers to understand how the warmth in communication by the supporting AI affect human's decision making and contribute to the science of Human-AI collaboration.
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - ANY PAID COMPENSATION FOR YOUR TIME?</strong><br> 
                If you complete the study in its entirety (all experiments and surveys) and provide valid responses during the study, you will be paid $2.00 through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Additional payments, of up to $1.00, will be paid depending on performance, which is based on how well you perform in your selected tasks. If you do not complete the study within the time-limit (45 minutes), your study will be ‘rejected,’ and you will not receive compensation. You may participate in this study only once. If you are disqualified from or otherwise finish the study, you may not participate again.
                <br><br>
                To make sure you are paying attention and putting forth adequate effort, the study includes attention checks and commensurate effort measures throughout the study. If you fail 3/10 or more attention checks or do not meet the threshold for effort measures, your work will be ‘rejected,’ and no compensation will be provided. You will not be able to continue the study.
                <br><br>
                At the end of the study, you will receive a code. Please do not submit HIT without the code, as you may risk being rejected.
                <br><br>
                Important: If you don't think that you have answered the responses thoughtfully and you are not sure you will pass a validity check, you should not submit your HIT.
                <br><br>
                You will only receive the compensation if you complete this study to its entirety (all experiments and surveys) and pass the validity and consistency checks within the 45-minute time limit. Please understand that we need to enforce these requirements to ensure the scientific validity of our experimental results.
                <br><br>
                Do not hit back/refresh buttons on the browser, or any browser manipulation, as it may affect the study, and violate the terms of the study, and may result in rejections. If you have any issues, please email Selim Karaoglu (selim-karaoglu@utulsa.edu), and we can review the logs to see what happened and help you.
            
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - HOW WILL YOUR INFORMATION/PRIVACY BE PROTECTED?</strong><br>
                During the study, you will not be asked any personal information except your MTurk worker ID (i.e., the 14 character sequence of letters and numbers used to identify workers). Your worker ID is necessary to link your work and worker ID for compensation. In other words, we need your worker ID to confirm that you successfully completed the task and to determine the exact amount of compensation based on your score in the study.
                <br><br>
                Your MTurk worker ID will NOT be shared with anyone and will be kept on the researcher’s password-protected computer and then deleted from our system after completing the study. The unidentifiable data will be kept on the researcher’s password-protected file, only accessible to the researcher. Furthermore, the web application where you will work on the task does not read/record your IP, location, or any other personal information.
            
                <br><br>Please note that MTurk has specific privacy policies of their own. If you have concerns, you should consult them directly at <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/privacynotice">https://www.mturk.com/mturk/privacynotice</a>
            
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - WHAT IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS THE RESEARCHERS PLAN TO RECRUIT FOR THIS STUDY?</strong><br>
                We expect to recruit up to 500 subjects for this study.
            
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - WHAT ARE THE CONDITIONS OF YOUR PARTICIPATION AND CAN YOU LEAVE THE STUDY BEFORE IT ENDS?</strong><br>
                You must be at least 18 years old and reside in the United States to participate in this study. Participation is voluntary. Refusal to participate will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. Your participation in this study is approximately 25 minutes. However, you can leave the study at any time, even if you have not finished, but you will be compensated only based on the compensation rules listed earlier.
            
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - CAN YOUR INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THIS STUDY BE SHARED OR USED BY OTHERS?</strong><br>
                Your identifiable information (MTurk worker ID) collected for this research study will not be used or distributed to other investigators for future research studies, even if your identifiers are removed.
            
                <br><br>
            
                <strong> - HOW WILL THE RESULTS BE USED?</strong><br>
                Results of this study, including summarized analysis of aggregated survey data, may be published on websites and in peer-reviewed conference proceedings, journals, and presentations. All surveys and modification efforts will be identified with random numbers. The data collected will be aggregated and used for research. As the data will be summarized across all participants, we will not be able to identify you from your data.
